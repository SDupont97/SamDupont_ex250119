Give the first 100 bases of the genomic FASTA sequence of the MYCN gene in the zebrafish.

go to the ncbi gene
look up MYCN AND zebrafish
click on the genbank record for this gene
click on refseq and go the the gene record page (NM_212614) you can find the full sequence at the bottom and if you take the first 100 
we already have the solution, however there is a more efficient way

go back to the genbank record and look at the part 'genomic context' there we find the chromosome and location: 20:33294442-33299644
so if we convert this into a curl query and just add 100 to the start of the sequence, we will just get the first 100 bases

curl 'http://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/region/zebrafish/20:33294442-33294542:1' -H 'Content-type:text/plain'
