Give the name of the chromosome with the second most genes that tell something about cancer. 


	Select chromosome, count(gene_id) from gene where description like “%cancer%” 
		group by chromosome
		order by count(gene_id) desc limit 1 offset 1;

What is the number of exons of this chromosome (9)?

Select chromosome, count(*) as total_exons from gene 
	join transcript on gene.gene_ID = transcript.gene_id
	join exon_transcript et on transcript.transcript_id = et.transcript_id 
	join exon e on et.exon_id = e.exon_id
	where chromosome = 9 group by chromosome order by total_exons desc limit 1;
