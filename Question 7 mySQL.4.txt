Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table. 
Explain why there is a difference in number of rows.

select count(*) from exon; = 642590

select count(*) from exon_transcript; = 1178393

there is a redundacy in the exon_transcript table, because oen exon can result in multiple transcripts
so the exons are repeated in the in the exon_transcript table.
